# Debug Steps - Profile Images Still Not Working

## üîç Issue Analysis

The error `Cannot GET /uploads/profile-images/` indicates that:
- Images are being requested from the **frontend domain** (`vendors.biec.in`)
- Instead of the **API domain** (`api.vendors.biec.in`)
- This means the client build is not using the correct environment variables

## üîß Immediate Fix Steps

### Step 1: Verify Client Environment File
Check your client `.env` file has exactly this content:

```bash
DISABLE_ESLINT_PLUGIN=true
NODE_OPTIONS=--no-deprecation
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.vendors.biec.in
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_5oxyeaa
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_yajf9hf
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_USER_ID=o3dwpHGpHKdlNsieC
REACT_APP_CLIENT_URL=https://vendors.biec.in
REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 2: Force Clean Build
```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd /path/to/your/client

# Remove old build and node_modules
rm -rf build/
rm -rf node_modules/
rm -rf .next/

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Build with environment variables
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Verify Build Contains Correct URLs
After building, check if the environment variables are embedded:

```bash
# Check if the build contains the correct API URL
grep -r "api.vendors.biec.in" build/
```

You should see references to `https://api.vendors.biec.in` in the build files.

### Step 4: Deploy New Build
Upload the entire contents of the `build/` folder to your web server.

## üß™ Alternative Quick Test

### Create a Test Environment File
Create a file named `.env.local` in your client directory:

```bash
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://api.vendors.biec.in
REACT_APP_CLIENT_URL=https://vendors.biec.in
REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=production
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

## üîç Debug Commands

### Check Current Environment in Build
```bash
# After building, check what API URL is being used
cd build/static/js/
grep -l "api.vendors.biec.in" *.js
```

### Check Network Requests
1. Open browser Developer Tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "XHR" or "Fetch"
4. Look for API calls - they should go to `api.vendors.biec.in`

## üéØ Expected vs Current Behavior

### Current (Wrong):
```
‚ùå Image URL: https://vendors.biec.in/uploads/profile-images/image.png
‚ùå Result: Cannot GET /uploads/profile-images/
```

### Expected (Correct):
```
‚úÖ Image URL: https://api.vendors.biec.in/uploads/profile-images/image.png
‚úÖ Result: Image loads successfully
```

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: Environment File Not Read
- Ensure `.env` file is in the root of client directory
- Ensure no extra spaces or characters in the file
- Ensure file is named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt`)

### Issue 2: Build Cache
- Old build cache might contain wrong URLs
- Always do a clean build when changing environment variables

### Issue 3: Deployment
- Ensure you're deploying the NEW build folder
- Clear browser cache after deployment

## üìû Next Steps

Please run these commands and let me know the results:

```bash
# 1. Check your current client .env file
cat /path/to/client/.env

# 2. Do a clean build
cd /path/to/client
rm -rf build/
npm run build

# 3. Check if build contains correct API URL
grep -r "api.vendors.biec.in" build/

# 4. Deploy and test
```

The issue is that your client build is not using the correct `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`. A clean rebuild should fix this!
